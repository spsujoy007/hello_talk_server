        "Can I memorize answers from other sources to use for my writing responses?",
      "answer":
        "Try to respond naturally with answers you are coming up with in the moment. Even if you have practiced answers to similar types of questions, your response should directly address the topic and be in your own words."

      "question":
        "I received a message that my session timed out. What does this mean and what should I do?",
      "answer":
        "This message appears when test-takers have a slow internet connection that leads to long question load times. When this happens, it is possible to reach the session time limit without completing enough questions to obtain an accurate score. In this case, you must retake the test, ideally with a stronger internet connection, and complete enough questions within the allotted time. If you must retake the test for this reason, you do not have to purchase the test again. If you are having trouble starting the test again, you may contact support."
